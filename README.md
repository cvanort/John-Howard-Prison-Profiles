# John-Howard-Prison-Profiles
<br>This repository contains the python scripts used to compile IDOC data to use as a data source for Tableau visualizations. The visualizations profile Illinois prisons, showing attributes of their current population, as well as how those attributes have changed over time. Attributes of interest include age, sex, race, holding offense, sentence length, admission type, recidivism, sentence credit eligibility, truth-in-sentencing requirements, and sentencing region.</br></br>
